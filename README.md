# BarCPP

First, I was about to implement this project only By the Drink,Beer,RedWine and WhiteWine classes, though, after reading again the question, 
I understood that it should be implemented with all the other subclasses (wine types), though, I still think that these classes 
are unneccessary, and must note, that I'd implement it differently.
